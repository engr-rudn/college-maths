# AP Calculus ABC Study Guide

Testing AsciiMath $$int e^-x^2 dx$$ and MathJax $$\int e^{-x^{2}}$$.

How do they work?

## Calculus A
Calculus A includes
- Limits and Continuity
- Derivatives and Differentiation Techniques
- Related Rates
- Optimization Problems
- Applications of the Above

### Limits

### Limits Involving Infinity

### Continuity

### Types of Discontinuity

### The Definition of the Derivative

### Differentiablity

### Differentiation Techniques

#### The Addition Rule

#### The Power Rule

#### The Product and Quotient Rules

#### The Chain Rule

#### Trigonometric Functions

### Concavity and the Double Derivative

**Concave Down**

## Calculus B
- Integrals and Integration Techniques
- Differential Equations
- Areas and Volumes of Bounded Regions
- Arc Length
- Surfaces of Revolutions
- Applications of the Above

### Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

### Integrals

#### Operations of Integrals

$$\int_a^b (f(x) \pm 5)dx = \int_a^b f(x)dx \pm \int_a^b 5dx$$

$$\int_a^b (5*f(x))dx = 5\int_a^b f(x)dx$$

### Integration

#### By Substitution

**Tabular** integration is a

#### By Parts

#### Trigonometric

### L'Hopital's Rule

### Concavity

### Length of an Arc
Given that $$f(x)$$ is differentiable,
$$s = \int_a^b \sqrt{1+(f'(x))^2}dx = \int_a^b \sqrt{1+(\frac{dy}{dx})^2}dx$$

### Work and Force

#### Work Done by a Force

#### Hooke's Law

The **force** required to maintain a spring stretched $$x$$ units _beyond its natural length_ is proportional to $$x$$.

$$F(x) = kx$$

$$force = (spring\ constant)\ (change\ in\ length)$$

#### Work Done Lifting

#### Work Done Pumping

$$w = \int_a^b (density)\ v(x)\ \Delta x\ dx$$

$$w = \int_a^b (density)\ (area)\ (distance\ travelled)\ (height)$$

## Calculus C
Calculus C includes
- Derivatives and Integrals of Parametric and Polar Equations
- Integration by Partial Fractions
- Improper Integrals
- Taylor and Maclaurin Series Convergence
- Applications of the Above
