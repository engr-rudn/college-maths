## 10.1 The Limit of a Complex Sequence

Let (z_n)_{n=1}^{\infty} be a sequence of complex numbers and let w be a complex number.

### Definition

The number w is said to be the limit of the sequence $$(z_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$$ if the following condition is satisfied:

For every $$\epsilon > 0$$, there exists a natural number N, such that $$|z_n - w| < \epsilon for all n \geq N$$.

Formally this definition is the same as that for convergence of real sequences; only that the absolute value is reinterpreted as the modulus of a complex number. A complex sequence $$(z_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$$ is said to be convergent if there exists some w, such that $$lim_{n \to \infty} z_n = w$$. If there is no such w then the sequence is said to be divergent. We will not make any use of infinite limits in the complex realm.
