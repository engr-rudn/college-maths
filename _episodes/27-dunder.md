In the previous episodes, we built a `Triangle` class that could
represent a triangle by storing the lengths of its sides. Now,
mathematically speaking, two triangles with identical sides are the
same triangle. Let's see if Python agrees with this.

~~~
a_triangle = Triangle([3, 4, 5])
the_same_triangle = Triangle([3, 4, 5])
if a_triangle == the_same_triangle:
    print("Python thinks that these triangles are the same.")
else:
    print("Python thinks that these are different triangles.")
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
Python thinks that these are different triangles.
~~~
{: .output}

So, despite these triangles having been constructed with exactly the
same side lengths, Python distinguishes between them. By default,
Python will only consider two objects to be the same if they are
_identical_:

~~~
a_triangle = Triangle([3, 4, 5])
duplicate_triangle = a_triangle
if a_triangle == duplicate_triangle:
    print("Python thinks that these triangles are the same.")
else:
    print("Python thinks that these are different triangles.")
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
Python thinks that these triangles are the same.
~~~
{: .output}

This isn't great for our triangle example&mdash;we would much prefer
if we could compare equality of triangles without having to compare
the `side_lengths` property by hand. Fortunately, Python gives us a
way of doing this. If we implement the `__eq__` method of `Triangle`,
then Python learns how to compare triangles.

~~~
class Triangle(Polygon):
    def __init__(self, side_lengths):
        # Triangles have three sides
        super().__init__(side_lengths)
        assert len(self.side_lengths) == 3

    @classmethod
    def equilateral(cls, side_length):
        return cls([side_length] * 3)

    def area(self):
        '''Returns the area of the triangle.'''
        a, b, c = self.side_lengths
        p = (a + b + c) / 2
        return (p * (p - a) * (p - b) * (p - c)) ** 0.5

    def __eq__(self, other):
        '''Returns True if the triangle self and the triangle other
        are the same triangle'''
        if not isinstance(other, Triangle):
            return False
        else:
            # Check all permutations
            if self.side_lengths == other.side_lengths:
                return True
            elif (self.side_lengths[1:] + [self.side_lengths[1]] ==
                    other.side_lengths):
                return True
            elif ([self.side_lengths[2]] + self.side_lengths[:-1] ==
                    other.side_lengths):
                return True
            return False

a_triangle = Triangle([3, 4, 5])
the_same_triangle = Triangle([3, 4, 5])
if a_triangle == the_same_triangle:
    print("Python thinks that these triangles are the same.")
else:
    print("Python thinks that these are different triangles.")

Great! We can compare equality. `__eq__` is the second example we've
seen of a so-called "special", "magic", or "dunder" (short for "double
underscore") method. These are methods that Python ascribes a special
meaning to; it guards the names of these with a double underscore `__`
on each side, so it is unlikely to collide with a name you might want
to use for a method of your own. These methods allow us to enable
instances of our classes to behave more like Python objects you're
used to dealing with, using the typical set of operators, rather than
needing to use method calls for everything.

Let's look at some more examples of these. Firstly, wouldn't it be
nice if we got something more descriptive when Python referred to our
`Triangle`s?

~~~
a_triangle
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<__main__.Triangle at 0x1235e7b00>
~~~
{: .output}

We can do this by implementing the `__repr__` method (short for
"representation"). This is designed to be something that looks like
Python code&mdash;ideally, something that if you pasted it back in, you'd
get the same (or at least a similar) object. For the `Triangle`, this
could look like:

~~~
    def __repr__(self):
        return f'Triangle({self.side_lengths})'
~~~
{: .language-python}

Testing this now gives:

~~~
a_triangle = Triangle([3, 4, 5])
a_triangle
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
Triangle([3, 4, 5])
~~~
{: .output}


## Other comparisons

What about if we want to know how two objects compare to each other?
We can do this by implementing `__lt__`, `__gt__`, `__le__`, `__ge__`,
and `__ne__`, representing `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, and `!=`
respectively. For example, an implementation of `__lt__` might look
like:

~~~
    def sides_with_max_first(self):
        max_index = self.side_lengths.index(max(self.side_lengths))
        if max_index == 0:
            return self.side_lengths
        elif max_index == 1:
            return self.side_lengths[1:] + [self.side_lengths[0]]
        else:
            return [self.side_lengths[2]] + [self.side_lengths[:2]]

    def __lt__(self, other):
        if self.area() != other.area():
            return self.area() < other.area()
        elif self.perimeter() != other.perimeter():
            return self.perimeter() < other.perimeter()
        elif self == other:
            return False
        else:
            return self.sides_with_max_first() < other.sides_with_max_first()
~~~
{: .language-python}

Testing this:

~~~
a_triangle = Triangle([3, 4, 5])
b_triangle = Triangle([5, 12, 13])
a_triangle < b_triangle
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
True
~~~
{: .output}

Python then does two very nice things for us: firstly, since we have
defined `__lt__`, it can now sort lists of `Triangle`s for us. And
while we could leave only the `<` operator defined, this could be
confusing for those using the class; fortunately, given
implementations of `__eq__` and `__lt__`, Python can automatically
generate the other relational operators using the
`functools.total_ordering` decorator.

~~~
from functools import total_ordering

   ...

## Callable objects

By implementing the `__call__` method, we can allow instances of a
class to be called like functions. For example, returning to the
`FunctionPlotter` example:

~~~
from numpy import linspace, sin
from matplotlib.colors import is_color_like
from matplotlib.pyplot import subplots

class FunctionPlotter:
    def __init__(self, color='red', linewidth=1, x_min=-10, x_max=10):
        self.color = color
        self.linewidth = linewidth
        self.x_min = x_min
        self.x_max = x_max

    @property
    def color(self):
        return self._color

    @color.setter
    def color(self, color):
        assert is_color_like(color)
        self._color = color

    def plot(self, function):
        '''Plot a function of a single argument.
        The line is plotted in the colour specified by color, and with width
        linewidth.'''
        fig, ax = subplots()
        x = linspace(self.x_min, self.x_max, 1000)
        ax.plot(x, function(x), color=self._color, linewidth=self.linewidth)

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.plot(*args, **kwargs)

plotter = FunctionPlotter()
plotter(sin)
~~~

## Collections and iterables

Python also gives us the power to make our objects behave like
iterable or collection types (for example tuples, lists, dicts, and
generators). For example, to let instances of the class behave with
the `len()` function, we implement `__len__()`. For example, adding
this to the `Polygon` class:

~~~
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.side_lengths)
~~~
{: .language-python}

will define the length of the object as the number of edges that the
`Polygon` has. (Note that we shouldn't make this the
perimeter&mdash;Python expects `len()` to return a non-negative
integer.) Testing this,

~~~
a_polygon = Polygon([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(len(a_polygon))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
5
~~~
{: .output}

We can also let our code loop over elements of our objects by
implementing the `__iter__()` method, which should return an
_iterator_; this is a particular type of object in Python that makes
things like `for` loops work. We can get one of these from any
iterable via the `iter()` function.

~~~
     def __iter__(self):
         return iter(self.side_lengths)
~~~
{: .language-python}

We can now iterate through the sides of our `Polygon`s without having
to get the `side_lengths` property each time.

~~~
a_polygon = Polygon([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
for side_length in a_polygon:
    print(side_length)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
1
2
3
4
5
~~~
{: .output}

## More dunder methods

Python offers many more dunder methods than could possibly be covered
in this episode. A full listing, categorised by the functions that
they serve, can be found in [the Python
