# Integration by Parts

## Concepts / Definitions

### Integration by Parts for Indefinite Integrals

If $$u$$ and $$v$$ are functions of $$x$$ and have continuous derivatives, then

$$\int udv = uv - \int vdu$$

$$\int f(x)g'(x)dx = f(x)g(x) = \int g(x)f'(x)dx$$

### Strategy

$$u = \ln x$$ as a first choice, then an algebraic type;
$$dv = $$ the functions where the derivative repeats ($$dv = $$ exponential or $$dv = $$ trig function)

As a general rule, when doing parts, $$\int udv$$ should be more complicated than $$\int vdu$$.

### Order

As we continue on when evaluating integrals

Order in which to calculate

- Try manipulating using algebra then just do it
- u-substitution
- Combination of Substitution and Algebra
- Integration by Parts
- Combination of any of the previous

## Examples

$$\int_0^1 \frac{2x + 1}{e^x} dx$$

$$\int e^{2x} \sin x dx$$
