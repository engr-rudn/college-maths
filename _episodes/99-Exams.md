<!-- > >To solve the integral $$\int \frac{1}{x^2 - 1} \, dx$$, we can decompose the denominator $$x^2 - 1$$ into its factors using partial fraction decomposition. Let's start by factoring the denominator:\
> >$$x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)$$\
> >The factors $$(x - 1)$$ and $$(x + 1)$$ are linear factors, so we can write the given fraction as:\
> >$$\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} = \frac{A}{x - 1} + \frac{B}{x + 1}$$\
> >To determine the values of $$A$$ and $$B$$, we can use algebraic manipulation or the method of coefficients. I will use the method of coefficients here.\
> >Multiplying both sides of the equation by $$x^2 - 1$$, we have:\
> >$$1 = A(x + 1) + B(x - 1)$$\
> >Expanding and collecting like terms, we get:\
> >$$1 = (A + B)x + (A - B)$$\
> >Equating the coefficients of like powers of $$x$$, we have the following system of equations:\
> >$$A + B = 0$$    (1)\
> >$$A - B = 1$$    (2)\
> >Solving the system of equations, we find $$A = \frac{1}{2}$$ and $$B = -\frac{1}{2}$$.\
> >Now, we can rewrite the integral using the partial fraction decomposition:\
> >$$\int \frac{1}{x^2 - 1} \, dx = \int \left(\frac{\frac{1}{2}}{x - 1} - \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{x + 1}\right) \, dx$$\
> >Integrating each term separately, we have:\
> >$$\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{1}{x - 1} \, dx - \frac{1}{2} \int \frac{1}{x + 1} \, dx$$\
> >Using the natural logarithm function, we can write:\
> >$$\frac{1}{2} \ln|x - 1| - \frac{1}{2} \ln|x + 1| + C$$\
> >Therefore, the final result of the integral is:\
> >$$\int \frac{1}{x^2 - 1} \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \ln|x - 1| - \frac{1}{2} \ln|x + 1| + C$$ -->
