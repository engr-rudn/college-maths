# 3-8 Derivatives of Inverse Functions


## Concepts / Definitions

### Derivatives of Inverse Functions
If $$f$$ is differentiable at every point of an interval $$I$$ and $$f'(x)$$ is never zero on $$I$$, then $$f$$ has an inverse, and $$f^{-1}$$ is differentiable at every point on the interval $$f(I)$$.<br>
If $$f^{-1}(a) = b$$, the inverse function slope relationship relates the derivatives by the equation $$(f^{-1})'(a) = \frac{1}{f'(b)}$$
