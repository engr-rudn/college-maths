### Derivatives of Inverse Functions
If $f$ is differentiable at every point of an interval $I$ and $f'(x)$ is never zero on $I$, then $f$ has an inverse, and $f^{-1}$ is differentiable at every point on the interval $f(I)$.<br>
If $f^{-1}(a) = b$, the inverse function slope relationship relates the derivatives by the equation $(f^{-1})'(a) = \frac{1}{f'(b)}$
