# Effective thinking through Maths #

## Week 0 ##

### Understanding deeply ###
Don't face complex issues head-on; first understand simple ideas deeply. Clear the clutter and expose what is really important. Be brutally honest about what you know and don't know. Then see what's missing, identify the gaps, and fill them in. Let go of bias, prejudice, and preconceived notion. There are degrees to understanding (it's not just a yes-or-no proposition) and you can always heighten yours. Rock-solid understanding is the foundation for success.

### Make mistakes ###
Fail to succeed. Intentionally get it wrong to inevitably get it even more right. Mistakes are great teachers - they highlight unforeseen opportunities and holes in your understanding. They also show you which way to turn next, and they ignite your imagination.

### Raise questions ###
Constantly create questions to clarify and extend your understanding. What's the real question? Working on the wrong questions can waste a lifetime. Ideas are in the air - the right questions will bring them out and help you see connections that otherwise would have been invisible.

### Follow the flow of ideas ###
Look back to see where ideas came from and then look ahead to discover where those ideas may lead. A new idea is a beginning, not an end. Ideas are rare - milk them. Following the consequences of small ideas can result in big payoffs.

### The quintessential element ###
The unchanging element is change - by mastering the first four elements, you can change the way you think and learn. You can always improve, grow, and extract more out of your education, yourself, and the way you live your life. Change is the universal constant that allows you to get the most out of living and learning.


## Week 1: Meanie Genie ##
On an archeological dig near the highlands of Tibet, Alley discovered an ancient oil lamp. Just for laughs she rubbed the lamp. She quickly stopped laughing when a huge puff of magenta smoke spouted from the lamp, and an ornery genie named Murray appeared. Murray, looking at the stunned Alley, exclaimed, “Well, what are you staring at? Okay, okay, you’ve found me; you get your three wishes. So, what will they be?” Alley, although in shock, realized she had an incredible oppor- tunity. Thinking quickly, she said, “I’d like to find the Rama Nujan, the jewel that was first discovered by Hardy the High Lama.” “You got it,” replied Murray, and instantly nine identical-looking stones appeared. Alley looked at the stones and was unable to differentiate any one from the others.

Finally she said to Murray, “So where is the Rama Nujan?” Murray explained, “It is embedded in one of these stones. You said you wished to find it. So now you get to find it. Oh, by the way, you may take only one of the stones with you, so choose wisely!” “But they look identical to me. How will I know which one has the Rama Nujan in it?” Alley questioned. “Well, eight of the stones weigh the same, but the stone containing the jewel weighs slightly more than the others,” Murray responded with a devilish grin.

Alley, becoming annoyed, whispered under her breath, “Gee, I wish I had a balance scale.” Suddenly a balance scale appeared. “That was wish two!” declared Murray. “Hey, that’s not fair!” Alley cried. “You want to talk fair? You think it’s fair to be locked in a lamp for 1729 years? You know you can’t get cable TV in there, and there’s no room for a satellite dish! So don’t talk to me about fair,” Murray exclaimed. Realizing he had gone a bit overboard, Murray proclaimed, “Hey, I want to help you out, so let me give you a tip: That balance scale may be used only once.” “What? Only once?” she said, thinking out loud. “I wish I had another balance scale.” ZAP! Another scale appeared. “Okay, kiddo, that was wish three,” Murray snickered. “Hey, just one minute,” Alley said, now regretting not having asked for one million dollars or something more standard. “Well at least this new scale works correctly, right?” “Sure, just like the other one. You may use it only once.” “Why?” Alley inquired. “Because it is a ‘wished’ balance scale,” he said, “so the rule is ‘one scale, one balancing’; it’s just like the rule against using one wish to wish for a hundred more wishes.” “You are a very obnoxious genie.” “Hey, I don’t make up the rules, lady, I just follow them,” he said.

# Reflecting and responding #
This puzzle's statement has many complications and aspects to it. Understanding what exactly is being asked is a great place to start thinking about a question. Uncovering the essence involves specifying what cannot be ignored and identifying and ignoring all of the distracting features that should be ignored.

For me personally this puzzle was easy, didn't take me long to find the same answer as in the course.

### Answer ###
* Split the rocks into groups of 3.
* Weigh group 1 and group 2. If one is heavier it contains the Ramanujan, and if
they are the same mass, the Ramanujan is in the 3rd group.
* Weigh the Ramanujan group with 1:1. If one is heavier it's the Ramanujan and if both weigh the same, the remaining rock is Ramanujan.

## Week 1: A Shaky Story ##
Stacy and Sam Smyth were known for throwing a heck of a good party. At one of their wild gatherings, five couples were present (this included the Smyths, of course). The attendees were cordial, and some even shook hands with other guests. Although we have no idea who shook hands with whom, we do know that no one shook hands with themselves and no one shook hands with his or her own spouse. Given these facts, a guest might not shake anyone’s hand or might shake as many as eight other people’s hands. At midnight, Sam Smyth gathered the crowd and asked the nine other people how many hands each of them had shaken. Much to Sam’s amazement, each person gave a different answer. That is, someone didn’t shake any hands, someone else shook one hand, someone else shook two hands, someone else shook three hands, and so forth, down to the last person, who shook eight hands. Given this outcome, determine the exact number of hands that Stacy Smyth shook.

### Answer ###
Stacy shook 1 hand.

## Week 2: The Puzzle of the Pirates and Admirals ##
Three Pirates and three Admirals walking together approach a river. The river is too wide to swim across and there is no bridge in sight, but there is a single row boat on the bank.
The boat is only big enough to fit two people at a time, and since it is not a magical boat, it requires at least one person to row it across the river.
Now the pirates, being as they are pirates, will attack the admirals if they ever outnumber them. If there are more admirals than pirates on a side, or an equal number, everyone will remain friendly.

### Answer ###
* 1P and 1A travel to the other bank
* 1A travels back to the first bank
* Ferry back the two remaining P to the other bank
* At this point we have 3P on the second bank and 3A on the first bank
* Send 2A to the second bank and take 1P back with 1A driving the boat
* Now we have 1P and 3A on the second bank and 2P on the first bank
* 1P returns to the right bank for his friends and returns with 2P
* 1P returns with the last pirate
* 3A and 3P are on the second bank

## Week 2: Extra puzzle ##
The fountain of knowledge. During an incredibly elaborate hazing stunt during pledge week, Trey Sheik suddenly found himself alone in the Sahara desert. His desire to become a fraternity brother was now overshadowed by his desire to find something to drink (these desires, of course, are not unrelated). As he wandered aimlessly through the desert sands, he began to regret his involvement in the whole frat scene. Both hours and miles had passed and Trey was near dehydration. Only now did Trey appreciate the advantages of sobriety. Suddenly, as though it were a mirage, Trey came upon an oasis.

There, sitting in a shaded kiosk beside a small pool of mango nectar, was an old man named Al Donte. Big Al not only ran the mango bar but was also a travel agent and could book Trey on a two-humped camel back to Michigan. At the moment, however,Trey desired nothing but a large drink of that beautifully translucent and refreshing mangoade. Al informed Trey that the juice was sold only in 8-ounce servings and that the cost for one serving was $3.50. Trey frantically searched all his pockets and found some change and much sand. Trey counted and discovered that he had exactly $3.50.

Trey’s jubilation at the thought of liquid coating his dried and chapped throat was quickly shattered when Al casually announced that there were no 8-ounce glasses available. Al had only a 6-ounce glass and a 10-ounce glass—neither of which had any markings on them. Al, being a man of his word, would not hear of selling any more or any less than an 8-ounce serving of his libation. Trey, in desperation, wondered whether it was possible to use the two glasses to produce exactly 8 ounces of mango juice in the 10-ounce glass. Trey thought and thought. Do you think it is possible to use only the unmarked 6- and 10-ounce glasses to produce exactly 8 ounces in the 10-ounce glass? If so, explain how, and if not, explain why not. This pledge week prank does whet our appetites for a world of numbers.

### Answer ###
Fill each glass halfway up. 5oz + 3oz = 8oz.

## Week 3: Counting before you can count ##
You are in a nursery as a 2 year old. You don't know how to count and you have candys. You need to divide them so that your friend and you get the same amount.

Two collections whose elements can be paired up into one-to-one correspondence have the same size. That is, if it is possible to take each element of one group, and pair it with exactly one element of the other group without any left-overs, then you know that both sets have the same number of elements in them. 

### Answer ###
One for you, one for me untill you run out of candys.

## Week 3: Barrels with ping pong balls ##
You have a barrel containing an infinite number of ping-pong balls and a barrel with an infite number of golf balls. Each ball has a natural number written on it, that is, there is a ping-pong ball and golf ball with the number 1, there is a ping-pong and a golf ball with the number 2, number 3... forever.

If you remove ping-pong ball number 1 from its barrel, do the two barrels of balls still have the same number of balls, or are there more golf balls now?

### Answer ###
I think the barrels still contain the same number of balls, since infinity both contain infinite number of balls. The numbering is not important.

## Week 3: The Infinity Inn ##
The team is taking up all of the motel rooms, so when the owner shows up people are going to have to move. 
Specifically, where should each player move and in what room will you put the owner so that every person--owner and each player--will be in a room by themselves? 

### Answer ###
How can we get all of the Giants and all of the Cardinals into rooms, so that each player has his own room? To answer this question, you need to state the room number in which Cardinal 1 will stay, the room number in which Cardinal 2 will stay, the room number in which Cardinal 3 will stay, and so on for all the Cardinals; and then also state the room number in which Giant 1 will stay, the room number in which Giant 2 will stay, ..., and so on for all the Giants as well.
By focusing on essentials, you noticed that to compare the sizes of two sets you can use the idea of one-to-one correspondence.
You learned that two sets of objects have the same cardinality if we can create a one-to-one correspondence between them. Through learning from mistakes, you discovered that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the natural numbers and the integers; that is, the integers and the natural numbers have the same cardinality.

## Week 4: Dodgeball with infinity ##
Player ones board: 6 by 6 places
Player two board: 6 by 2 places

Rules:
- There are two players.

- Player 1 fills in the first row with an X or an O in each of the six boxes in row 1.

- Player 2 then puts an X or an O in the first column of his or her row (remember, Player 2 only has one row)

- Then the process repeats. Player 1 fills in all of row 2 by putting an X or an O in each of the six boxes of row 2; and then Player 2 puts a single X or O in the second column in Player 2's row.

- The process repeats until Player 1 has filled in all six rows and Player 2 has filled in his or her single row. 

- Both players can see everything at all times.

- The goal of the game: Player 2 is trying to create a row that is different from every one of Player 1's six rows; so Player 2 wants to 'dodge' all of Player 1's rows (hence the name Dodgeball). Player 1, on the other hand, is trying to make one of his six rows exactly match Player 2's final row.

- Player 1 wins if, after all the squares have been filled, one of Player 1's six horizontal rows exactly matches Player 2's row; and Player 2 wins if Player 2's row differs from every one of Player 1's six horizontal rows.

- Note: We are only interested in horizontal rows--vertical rows or diagonal rows don't matter.

### Player Two can always win ###
The strategy that Julie described that will always guarantee victory for Player Two is to just do the opposite of what Player One does at each stage, that is, when the game starts and Player One puts down a sequence of X's and O's in his first row, Player Two ignores everything except the mark that Player One put in the first position of the first row. Then Player Two puts the opposite mark in her first position of her row. Having done that, no matter what happens later, Player Two knows that her row will not be the same as Player One's first row, because Player Two row will different from Player One's first row in the first position. (Player Two's row may also different elsewhere, but at a minimum, Player Two's row will differ from Player One's first row in the first position. 

Now Player One writes down his second row. Player Two ignores everything except what mark Player One put in the second position of his second row. Player Two puts the opposite mark in the second position of her row. Having done that, Player Two knows for certain that Player Two's row will different from Player One's second row in the second position.

This method goes on. For example, to decide what mark Player Two will put in the fifth position of her row, she just looks at what mark Player One put in the fifth position of his fifth row, and Player Two puts the opposition mark in the fifth position of her row. In that manner, Player Two guarantees that her row will definitely not be the same as Player One's fifth row since Player Two's row will definitely differ from Player One's fifth row in the fifth position.

Since every one of Player One's rows has a position in which it is guaranteed to be different from Player Two's row, then Player Two's row is different from each one of Player One's rows, and therefore, Player Two is absolutely guaranteed to win.

### Infinity ###
Scott's "Buy Every Ticket" strategy failed because he was unable to make a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all  possible sequences of X's and O's and the row numbers (the natural numbers). When it is impossible to make a one-to-one correspondence between two sets, we know that that means that the two sets do not have the same cardinality. Since we saw conclusively that the set of natural numbers (the row numbers) cannot be put into 1-1 correspondence with the set of all possible sequences of X's and O's, we are forced to conclude that infinity comes in different sizes!! What an idea. 

It is important to try to stay open-minded about things. In this case, we had to be open-minded about the possibility of infinity coming in different sizes. This idea seems completely impossible, yet we have just proved that there are different sizes of infinity by playing the game of Dodgeball.  Similarly, by staying open-minded in our daily lives, we can all experience unexpected insights that we had never seen before. 

Could there be a one-to-one correspondence between the natural numbers and all the decimal numbers between 0 and 1?

Re-using the same method that was used with Dodgeball--in this case to show that the decimal numbers between 0 and 1 do not have a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. She is able to use this old idea in a new setting because the underlying concept in both instances is the same--we want to show that two sets have a different cardinality. Old ideas are the richest source for creating new ideas. Rather than creating a whole other proof, Julie used her previous knowledge to apply to a new situation.
