# Rates of Change

## Concepts / Definitions

### Velocity
The instantaneous velocity is the derivative of the position function $$s = f(t)$$
with respect to time.
$$v(t) = \frac{ds}{dt}$$

### Speed
Speed is the absolute value of velocity.<br>
Speed = $$\lvert v(t)\rvert$$

### Acceleration
Acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time. If a body's velocity at time $$t$$ is $$v(t) = \frac{ds}{dt}$$, then the body's acceleration at time $$t$$ is
$$a(t) = \frac{d}{dt}v(t) = \frac{d^2}{dt^2}$$

The _jerk_ is the derivative of acceleration.

### Free-fall Constants (Earth)
$$g = 32.2\frac{ft}{sec^2},\quad s = \frac 12 (32.2)t^2 = 16.2t^2$$ where $$s$$ is in feet<br>
$$g = 9.8\frac{m}{sec^2},\;\:\quad s = \frac 12 (9.8)t^2 = 4.9t^2$$ where $$s$$ is in meters

### Rate of Change in Economics
In Economics, marginals are used instead of the derivative.<br>
For example, marginal cost is the cost ot produce one more item when a certain amount of items are produced.

### Examples

A particle moves along a line so that its position at any time $$t \geq 0$$ is given by the function $$s(t) = t^3 -6t^2 + 9t$$, where $$s$$ is measured in meters and $$t$$ is measured in seconds.

  1. Find the displacement of the particle during the first 2 seconds. Show work.
  2. Find the average velocity of the particle suring the first 4 seconds and find the velocity after 4 seconds. Show work.
  3. When is the particle moving forward? Explain your answer.
  4. Find the acceleration of the particle after 4 seconds.
  5. Find the distance travelled during the first 5 seconds.
  6. When is the particle speeding up?
