# Algebra and Functions

## 2.1 - Laws of indices
Understand and use all laws of indices for all rational exponents.
>$$
a^m * a^n = a^{m+n}
$$
$$
(a^{m})^{n} = a^{mn}
$$
$$
a^{\frac{m}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a^m}
$$

## 2.2 - Using surds
Use and manipulate surds, including *rationalising the denominator*.
>$$
(\sqrt{x})^2 = x
$$
$$
\sqrt{xy} = \sqrt{x}\sqrt{y}
$$
$$
(\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y})(\sqrt{x}-\sqrt{y}) = x-y
$$

## 2.3 - Quadratics
Be comfortable working with quadratic functions and their graphs ($$f(x)$$)

### Discriminant
An equation to find the number of roots of a function
>$$
b^2-4ac > 0,
$$ The roots are real and unequal (curve crosses the x axis twice at different points)
>$$
b^2-4ac = 0,
$$ The roots are real and equal (curve crosses x axis once at the turning point) 
>$$
b^2-4ac < 0,
$$ The roots are non real (curve never crosses x axis)

### Completing the square
The process of converting a quadratic to a perfect square form with a remainder.
>$$
ax^2+bx+c = a(x+\frac{b}{2a})^2 + (c-\frac{b^2}{4a})
$$

### Methods of solving quadratic equations
Must be able to solve quadratics (Find roots, turning points etc) by the following methods:
* Factorisation
* Use of quadratic formula ($$
x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$)
* Use of calculator (Classwiz)
* Completing the square

## 2.4 - Solving simultaneous equations
Must be able to solve simultaneous equations in two variables by elimination and by substitution, including one linear and one qudratic equation.

### Example:
Solve :
$$
y=2x+3, y=x^2-4x+8
$$
>$$
2x+3 = x^2-4x+8
$$
>$$
x^2-6x+5 = 0
$$
>$$
(x-5)(x-1) = 0
$$
>$$
\text{Therefore}
$$
>$$
x = 5, x = 1
$$

## 2.5 - Linear and quadratic inequalities
Must be able to solve and interpret inequalities, e.g.
$$
ax+b > cx+d
$$
$$
px^2+qx+r \ge 0
$$
$$
px^2+qx+r < ax+b
$$

### Rearranging
$$
\frac{a}{x} < b\;
$$ becomes $$
\;ax < bx^2
$$

### Expressing solutions
Correct use of 'and' and 'or', "$$
x < a\text{ or }x > b
$$ is the same as 
$$
\{x: x < a\} \cup \{x: x > b\}
$$

## 2.8 - Understand and use composite/inverse functions
A function is a one to one mapping from $$
\mathbb{R}
$$ to

### Example:
Find $$
f^-1(x)
$$ of the function
$$
f(x) = x^2+2x-3,\; x \ge 0
$$
>**Step 1: Complete the square**
>Using [the above formula](#completing-the-square):
>$$
f(x) = (x+1)^2-4
$$
>**Step 2: Rearrange for x**
>$$
y = (x+1)^2-4
$$
>$$
y+4 = (x+1)^2
$$
>$$
\sqrt{y+4}-1=x,\; y \ge -4
$$
