# Normal Distribution
* Half the data is on the left of the peak, half on the right
* Mean, median and mode are all the same value
* Can't find value $$P(X=N)$$ for any $$N$$ as you can't integrate to an absolute value
* Curve has points of inflection one standard deviation from the mean
  * This means the curve changes concavity
* __Standard Deviations__:
  * $$1\times\sigma$$ = 68% of the data
  * $$2\times\sigma$$ = 95% of the data
  * $$3\times\sigma$$ = 99.7% of the data

## Syntax
$$X \sim B(n,p)$$
$$n$$ is the mean, $$p$$ is the square of the standard deviation
$$X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$$
$$\mu$$ represents the center
$$\sigma$$ represents one standard deviation

## Example
>1. Diameters of a rivet modelled by $$X \sim N(8, 0.2^2)$$
a) Find $$P(X>8)$$
  50%
b) Find $$P(7.8 < X < 8.2)$$
1 sd so 68%

>2. Criteria for joining Mensa is an IQ of at least 131.
Assuming that IQ has the distribution $$X \sim N(100, 15^2)$$ for a population
a) What percentage of people are eligible?
$$P(X>=131)$$ = 1.9%
