# Quadratic Inequalities

## Solving a quadratic inequality

E.g. let's solve $$x^2 < 36$$. Steps:
- First find the zeroes - remember, the zeroes have to satisfy the condition $$\mathrm{zero} < 36$$
- Then, test out one number _between_ the zeroes, one number _greater_ than the zeroes, and one number _less_ than the zero
    - Let's try 0
    - If we plug 0 into the equation, we know that $$(0^2) = 0 < 36$$, so we know that the zero 0 works
    - That means any value between -6 and 6 must be true, since 0 is in this range and satisfies the condition
    - Let's try -10
    - If we plug -10 into the equation we know that $$(-10^2) = 100 \nel 100$$, so we know that the zero -10 works
    - So the lower bound of the range will be -6

Answer: $$-6 < x < 6$$

- Two methods: graph (2D) method or number line (1D) method
